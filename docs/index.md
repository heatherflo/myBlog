Do you ever do that thing where you look at something and it makes you think of something else, then your brain goes to something else and before you know it, you are lost in thought and you have no idea how you got to the thought you were on? There is this picture of my daughter I took a long time ago (when it was easier to take pictures of my kids) where she is sitting in a dance costume (or maybe its a princess dress?) on the floor near great window light. I remember asking her to sit in this particular spot do that I could take this picture. I bet she got upset with me. I am sure she didn't want to sit for this picture and I am sure she didn't enjoy it. Neither of my kids did. But then I thought of this moment in time where I took her picture and Jason was there. But he wasn't 'there'. I didn't notice him until I up0loaded that picture into Lightroom days later. And all you see are his legs. Cause yeah, he was never the main event. He was never there. I am surprised he went to this event. I bet he didn't want to go to this event. He rarely wanted to spend time with the kids. And while that may actually not be true, my memory states this. And isn't that the whole point? Perception is everything.

The beginning of my journey. Heck. Where do I start? I am not sure I want anyone to see this, and I am not sure what to make this about. However, here I am giving it a try. I always feel like I am reinventing myself into something new. I always thought I knew what I wanted. Turns out I was wrong. And to say I was "wrong" is not exactly right. I thought I knew what I was doing. A friend you admire in childhood wants to be a certain thing in life. And because you have no idea what to do in your own life, you adopt her way of doing things. What she wanted was what I wanted. And for a long time, I thought that was true. I went full speed ahead with the goal of being a veterinarian. I wanted so badly to help animals that were incapable of helping themselves. I had the sad experience of being with my mom when we had to put my cat down and while it was sad- I knew this was what I wanted. As time went on, I started to experiment with the idea of what it would be like to be a vet. And as I began to volunteer more and see how the business was run, I realized that I, in fact, did not want to actually be a vet. To be the one person responsible for the health and well being for an animal when it was sick, sounded daunting. And truthfully, I was scared. Once I realized I wanted to take my career into a different direction, I decided to stop all schooling except for the things I needed to get done. I am so thankful for my step-dad who convinced me to actually still pursue my bachelor's degree in full. Even though I don't use the degree for much today, having it is something that I really value.

To be honest, I have lived a lot of my life in fear. Fear that I wouldn't do well in the vet roll, fear that no one else would love me besides the person that was loving me at the time, fear of losing friends. And as I have gotten older I have realized that the only important thing for me to do is to love myself and do for myself what I need to be happy. The only person that controls my world is me. And the only person that matters in my own happiness is me. Now, of course I love my family and I want them to help me succeed in my happiness but they are in charge of themselves and they cannot be responsible for me. The people I choose to spend my life with are the most important people to me and I alone can control how much time I give these people. How much of my energy is going to be spent on the things that I love and the people I love or just me by myself. 

So the idea of this blog is still forming and I don't know what it will turn into but I will try to add to it daily so I can keep this going - FOR ME.
